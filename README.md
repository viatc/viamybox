# ViaMyBox

[ViaMyBox](https://viamybox.com) is a raspberry pi project. It combines several functional ideas and the possibility of simplified management of this functionality. Functional management is carried out through the console script via-setup.sh, through the Home Assistant console as well as a mini-web interface.
In the ViaMyBox project, I combined some ideas found on the Internet that seem interesting to me and the opportunity
quick setup and management. The main functionality at the moment is video recording, a smart home based on the Home Assistant,
Kodi Home Theater, Wordpress LNMP Server.
Modules Home Assistant, MotionEye are optional; install via via-setup.sh utility.
The LNMP server is optionally installed separately (see /home/pi/viamybox/scripts/lnmp/README).

ViaMyBox distribution is assembled and tested based on 2019-09-26-raspbian-buster.The functionality provided by ViaMyBox is:

**Video Recording**:
- video recording with synchronization of sound from a usb camera using [gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) technology
- audio recording from usb camera via [gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) technology
- timelapse video recording from usb or csi camera using ffmpeg
- photo registration via mjpg-streamer
- photo recording by hc-sr501 motion sensor
- creation of a video file after photo registration
- the ability to record audio and video on yandex disk

**Smart house** - Home Assistant based on docker image https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-installer:
- management via the console utility via-setup.sh docker containers of Home Assistant
  installation and removal of the image. Stop and start the Home Assiatnt containers
- control via the web console Home Assistant of the above video registration functions
- some raspberry pi control functions. CPU temperature control, micro sd volume,
  power supply status

**Kodi Home Theater**

**MotionEye** web management based on the docker image https://hub.docker.com/r/ccrisan/motioneye:
- web-based interface MotionEye
- management through the console utility via-setup.sh docker container
  installation and removal of the docker image and containers. Stop and start docker container.

**Web interface**:
- management of video recording functions

**Console utility via-setup.sh**:
- management of video recording functions

## INSTALLATION

### Before Installation

The project uses and install nginx, mjpg-streamer, gstreamer, docker, kodi and related packages through

Browse and exclude sections of packages that are not required by you functionality.

Mjpg-streamer will be installed with the script ~/viamybox/scripts/prepostinstall/01aftercopy.sh
The ViaMyBox project uses the mjpg-streamer of the jacksonliam project https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer
If you use another mjpg-streamer, exclude the section # mjpg-streamer from the 01aftercopy.sh file

If you are using apache web server or nginx, look in the #nginx section in the file.
ViaMyBox uses a web server at the address /home/pi/viamybox/www on port 80
If the port 80 for the web server is allocated, change the port in the file /home/pi/viamybox/conffiles/viamybox.local
before installation.
